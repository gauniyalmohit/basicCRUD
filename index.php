threat agents) whih may threaten it. Generally intelligene units have threat, where they monitor and keep trak of the people who may threaten their
operations. This is natural, sine it is easier to get an idea of who will try anddo something than how some unspeied person may try to do it, and
an helpby hardening systems in enemy territory more than those in safer areas, leadingto more eient use of resoures. I shallall this adversary modeling.
In adversary modeling, the impliit assumptions are that you have a limitedbudget and the number of threats is so large that youannot defend against allof them. So you now need to de
ide where to alloate your resoures.
